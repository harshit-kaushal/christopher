%This function decrypts the encryped phrase. The user is asked to enter the

%defined just for this purpose. The numbers are then numtiplied by a the
%modular inverse of the key as 2x1 matrices. The answers obtained from this
%multiplication are converted back into text, giving the user the original
%decryped phrase.
